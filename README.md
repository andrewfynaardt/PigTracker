# Track the Oinks
Aaron Cumming, Andrew Fynaardt, Calli Korner, Heidi Blank

Track the Oinks takes input about pigs and keeps track of the information and previous farms the pig has  
been at. This is useful for farmers who have a sick pig so they can contact owners of farms the pig was  
previously at to warn them their pigs might be sick.
